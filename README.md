Dropping-Description-Cell
=========================

A UITableViewCell that is able to drop down inside of its own UITableViewController and display details about information in selected table view row.


How To Use It
=============

There is nothing special when using this code. All that you have to do is import the classes "MyTableViewController.h"/.m and "CustomCell.h"/m. You can create any identifier that you would like, but I would recommend doing it within a storyboard. Create a subclass of table view controller, and set the class to "MyTableViewController." Make sure the cell id is matching, and that should be all. There are 2 #define at the top of the table view controller for the needed material.
